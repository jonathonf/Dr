Inspired by https://github.com/Xeoncross/Jr[Jr], _Dr_ is a static-static content
generator for AsciiDoc-formatted documents. Have a look at the page source!


== What is AsciiDoc?
[quote, AsciiDoc website, http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/]
____
AsciiDoc is two things:

* A mature, plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles,
  documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages
  and more.
* A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various
  formats (called backends), including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub.

Visit the http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc site] for an introduction to AsciiDoc.


== How this works

All pages are plain text with a single Javascript entrypoint included on each page.
The Javascript then parses the AsciiDoc and renders the theme and assets as needed.

In common with Jr, this means:

* minimal bandwidth requirements
* better search engine indexing
* awesome screen reader support

but, because it's AsciiDoc, you get many more features compared to Markdown. File
includes, image embedding, proper tabular data, a table of content, footnotes, ...


== How do I use it?

. Write your AsciiDoc document
. Add the following tag to the end:
[source,html]
&lt;script data-main="js/dr" src="js/require.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
. Save it with a `.html` file extension and view it in a browser.


== Components

The _Dr_ project is based around several components:

* A tweaked `asciidocify.js` that takes care of the AsciiDoc input, taken from the 
  https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-firefox-addon[Asciidoctor Firefox addon];
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[asciidoctor.js] for the conversion back-end;
* https://github.com/google/code-prettify[prettify] for syntax highlighting;
* http://requirejs.org[RequireJS] for a single entry point and post-load actions.


== Example elements

.Numbered list
. item 1.footnote:[This might not actually be first]
. item 2

.Source code
[source,ruby]
area = "World"
puts "Hello, #{area}"

[source,bash]
for i in Hello World; do
    echo $i
done

.Tabular data from CSV items
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
Artist,Track,Genre
Baauer,Harlem Shake,Hip Hop
The Lumineers,Ho Hey,Folk Rock

== Additional scripts

Additional scripts can be included to gain extra functionality; the additional
script just needs to be included somewhere, whether as an element on an
individual page, or within `js/dr.js`.  For example, the following elements use
https://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax].

.LaTeX Math
latexmath:[$C = \alpha + \beta Y^{\gamma} + \epsilon$]

.MathJax
When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
\(x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\)

.LaTeXMathML
latexmath:[$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n}$]

See the http://asciidoc.org/userguide.html#X78[AsciiDoc user guide] for more
information on including mathematical formulae.
